      <h3>Clownfish</h3>
      <p>
        Clownfish are some of the most vibrant and charismatic residents of coral reefs, 
        instantly recognizable by their bright orange bodies adorned with striking white stripes. 
        which protect them from predators while the clownfish, in return, keeps the anemone clean and well-fed. 
        Known for their bold personalities, clownfish are also fascinating because of their ability to change sex; 
        the dominant female leads the group, and if she dies, the largest male transforms into a female to take her place. 
        Their captivating colors, quirky behavior, and incredible teamwork make clownfish true stars of the underwater world.

        <ul>
          <li>All clownfish are born male. When they form a pair, 
            the dominant fish becomes female, and the other stays male. 
            If the female dies, the male changes sex and becomes the female. 
            This is a process called sequential hermaphroditism.</li>
          <li>Clownfish communicate with each other using a series of pops, clicks, and grunts.
             These sounds are thought to help them communicate with their mates or other fish, especially 
             when defending their territory. They make these sounds by rapidly expelling air through their mouths.</li>
          <li>They form symbiotic relationships with sea anemones.</li>
          <li>They lay eggs that hatch in 6–10 days.</li>
