# ðŸŒŠ Virtual Aquarium

Welcome to the **Virtual Aquarium** by Mriganka, an interactive web project built for a university assignment. Explore the wonders of the deep blue seaâ€”from vibrant coral reefs to the graceful dance of ocean creatures. Dive into an interactive journey through marine ecosystems, rare species, and the hidden beauty of life beneath the surface, all from the comfort of your screen.

## How to Run the Project
Follow these steps to run the Virtual Aquarium locally on your machine:

### Prerequisites
- A web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge).
- No server required (static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project).

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open your terminal and navigate to your desired directory:
     ```bash
     cd ~/path/to/your/folder
     git clone https://github.com/mriganka93/Virtual-Aquarium-Website.git
     cd Virtual-Aquarium-Website
Known Issues

Hero Video: The hero video (ocean_water.mp4) may not load due to file path issues or missing upload, displaying the fallback text "Your browser does not support the video tag." Ensure the file is in the images/ folder and uploaded to the repository. A poster attribute with a static image (e.g., stingray.jpg) has been added as a fallbackâ€”upload this image if needed.
Contact Form: The form is static and wonâ€™t send emails without backend integration (e.g., Formspree). Itâ€™s for demonstration only.

Technologies Used

HTML5: Provides the structure for all web pages.
CSS3: Handles styling, including responsive design, animations, and the hamburger menu toggle.
JavaScript: Enables interactivity, such as the hamburger menu, accordion, and Learn More toggles.
Font Awesome: Supplies icons for visual enhancement (e.g., social media links).

Installation
No additional dependencies or software installations are required. Simply clone the repository and open the files in a modern web browser.
Usage
